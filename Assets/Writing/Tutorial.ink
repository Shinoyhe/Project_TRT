=== Tutorial ===
Getting someone to barter with you is as simple as making 'em willing enough. #NPC
Making someone willing just means ya' gotta know how to respond to their tone cards with ya' own! #NPC
If you tell 'em what they wanna hear, they'll be more willing. Say somethin' with the wrong tone and they'll be less likey to barter with ya'. #NPC
Some tone responses won't affect their willingness, but instead affects the next tone cards they play. #NPC
People 'round 'ere aren't gonna show you their hand as soon as you talk to 'em. It's up to you to find out what clicks with people. No two people are alike neitha'. #NPC
Seems like you've got somethin' to write in too. Speaking from experience, it's a good idea to write down any info ya' learn from a barter. 'Specially proper tone card responses. #NPC
Most importantly, don't waste no one's time. We've got people ta' barter with, and people get <i>real</i> unwilling with slow barterers. #NPC

Clear on all that newbie? #NPC
+ Crystal.
    -> Barter
+ Remind me again would you?
    Can talk 'bout it all day. #NPC

*This dusty thing? Doubt it's good for anything anyways.
    Sounds perfect... #NPC
