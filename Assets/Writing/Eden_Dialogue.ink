Greetings, wanderer. How may we of the Order be of assistance to you? #NPC

* I would like to Barter. 
    -> Barter
*The Order?
    As in the Church. I pray for the safety and longevity of each individuals’ soul. #NPC
    ->The_Order
* {IC_info_card_2} I've heard some rumors.
    -> UnlockBarterOption
* {IC_info_card_4 and not date_note} I have news you should hear.
    Is it about Fixey I-I MEAN... I mean F1X? #NPC
    **It seems like they might feel the same.
        Th-they do!? Oh wanderer please tell me it is so. #NPC
        I do not wish to be a bother, but do you think you can run another errand for me? #NPC

        ~IC_date_note = true
        ***I'm not one to get in the way of love, sure.
            Blessed wanderer, I thank you. Please give this note to F1X so we may meet. I cannot give it to her myself otherwise the church would lambast me. #NPC
            **** I'd be happy to.
                I'll be praying for your safe travel. #NPC

*Isn’t charity supposed to be indiscriminate?
    While this is true, we can’t offer resources to every sorry sap wandering into the commune. I do hope you understand, Feline Wanderer. #NPC
    ->The_Order
*Soul?
    Yes, soul. We call it ‘fruit of the soul’, the organic matter that powers our cores. Every living bot has one. #NPC
    ->The_Order
*Do you usually just wait here?
    Not usually, Dear Wanderer. I am often running errands for the people of the commune or listening to their problems someplace else. You have found me during a rare rest period. 
    **Rare?
        ...#NPC
        Do not worry. Someone must do all this work for the betterment of every soul on this Earth. #NPC
        ->The_Order
*I want to talk about something else.

Rumors are often unsubstantiated, please do not waste either of our time on such things. #NPC.
    *Do you like F1X?
        I-She... There may be some substantiation to this rumor... #NPC
        I simply think that she is misunderstood, and I'd like to get to know her better. #NPC
            ** {IC_solar_panel} I've got something of hers.
                Are you interested in perhaps bartering for it? #NPC
